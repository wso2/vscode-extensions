# Phase 4 Implementation Notes

## Overview
This document captures key decisions, learnings, and notes during the implementation of Phase 4.

## Document Structure Created

Created the following documentation structure:
- `doc/` - Main documentation directory for implementation phases
- `doc/README.md` - Overview of the documentation directory
- `doc/task_list.md` - Task tracking for Phase 4
- `doc/phase4_plan.md` - Detailed implementation plan

## Key Decisions

### Documentation Structure
- **Decision:** Create separate `doc/` directory for implementation docs
- **Rationale:** Distinguish from user-facing `docs/` directory
- **Impact:** Clear separation between internal planning and external documentation

### Phase 4 Scope
- **Decision:** Focus on four main pillars: Documentation, Testing, Developer Experience, Infrastructure
- **Rationale:** These areas have the highest impact on project sustainability
- **Impact:** Provides clear structure for implementation

### Timeline Approach
- **Decision:** Estimate 12-week duration for Phase 4
- **Rationale:** Based on scope and typical team velocity
- **Impact:** Sets realistic expectations for stakeholders

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- [x] Created doc/ directory structure
- [x] Created task_list.md with comprehensive task breakdown
- [x] Created phase4_plan.md with detailed implementation approach
- [x] Created implementation_notes.md for tracking decisions

### In Progress
- None yet - awaiting approval to begin implementation

### Blocked
- None yet

## Lessons Learned

### Documentation
- Clear task breakdown helps with planning and tracking
- Separating concerns (user docs vs. implementation docs) improves organization
- Including success metrics makes progress measurable

## Open Questions

1. When should Phase 4 officially begin?
2. Who are the assigned team members for each sub-phase?
3. What are the priorities if timeline needs to be compressed?
4. How will we handle documentation for multiple extension versions?

## Next Actions

1. Review documentation structure with team
2. Get stakeholder approval on timeline and resource allocation
3. Assign owners to each sub-phase
4. Schedule kick-off meeting
5. Create first sprint backlog items
