I want you to migrate the drift check feature to use ai sdk framework similar to other ai feature instead of relying on the backend api call. 

Backend code is in - /Users/wso2/repos/ballerina-copilot/copilot_api/service.bal Line 405

For prompts, create a new function with paramters(instead of using regex replace). Make sure to use exact prompts used in the backend md file. 

Make sure to migrate both api docs path and documentaiton path. 

Use ai sdk framework similar to other ai features.
